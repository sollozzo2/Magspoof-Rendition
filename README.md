# Magspoof-Rendition
Implementation of Samy Kamkar's https://github.com/samyk/magspoof
I thought magspoof was really cool, so I made one with an Arduino. Also a $3 card reader to test it.

Sprinkled iron oxide on my ID to decode the binary information on it, by taking a picture of it and marking each bit on MS Paint.

Tried replaying the binary information to the access control card readers, to no avail.
Made different play-heads to see if there's a difference.

Still working to see what works on these readers!
